## Description

I created a README application in node in order to help user's create a proffesional looking README for themselves. I wanted to make it into a simple task as the real project, coding, can take up alot of time and effort. This application takes out the guess work and time commitment that it normally would take to create. While creating this README app I learned that if you put a little extra time into somethings it can help you and possibly others in the long run.

## Installation
1.) Download node onto your computer.
2.) Install node into your project folder
3.) Install gitignore folder. Type "node_modules" into the folder and save.
3.) Watch the tutorial on the application
4.) Follow the prompts to create your proffesional README.md

## Usage
Installation directions have been stated above. Please follow these and watch the tutorial with the provided link below.
